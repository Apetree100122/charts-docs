* Install Redis Cluster by running the following:

  > NOTE: Remember that MY-RELEASE is a placeholder, replace it with the name you want to give to the chart or add the `--generate-name` to give the chart a random name.

        $ helm install MY-RELEASE bitnami/redis-cluster

> TIP: In case you get a timeout error, try to execute again the command above by adding the *--timeout* parameter.
