The [Bitnami RabbitMQ image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-rabbitmq) stores the RabbitMQ data and configurations at the */opt/bitnami/rabbitmq/var/lib/rabbitmq/* path of the container.

The chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) at this location. By default, the volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning. An existing PersistentVolumeClaim can also be defined.

### Existing PersistentVolumeClaims

* Create the PersistentVolume
* Create the PersistentVolumeClaim
* Install the chart

    $ helm install my-release --set persistence.existingClaim=PVC_NAME bitnami/rabbitmq

### Adjust permissions of the persistence volume mountpoint

As the image runs as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions. As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting volumePermissions.enabled to *true*.
