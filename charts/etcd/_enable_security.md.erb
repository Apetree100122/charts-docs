### Configure RBAC

In order to enable Role-based access control for etcd you can set the following parameters:

~~~
auth.rbac.enabled=true
auth.rbac.rootPassword=ETCD_ROOT_PASSWORD
~~~

The previous command will deploy etcd creating a root user with its associate root role with access to everything. The rest of users will use the guest role and won't have permissions to do anything.

### Configure certificated for peer communication

In order to enable secure transport between peer nodes deploy the helm chart with these options:

~~~
auth.peer.secureTransport=true
auth.peer.useAutoTLS=true
~~~

### Configure certificates for client communication

In order to enable secure transport between client and server you have to create a secret containing the cert and key files and the CA used to sign those client certificates.

You can create that secret and deploy the helm chart with these options:

~~~
auth.client.secureTransport=true
auth.client.enableAuthentication=true
auth.client.existingSecret=etcd-client-certs
~~~
