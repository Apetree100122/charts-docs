* Number of aggregator nodes:
  
    - aggregator.replicaCount: 1
    + aggregator.replicaCount: 2

    - metrics.enabled: false
    + metrics.enabled: true

To horizontally scale this chart once it has been deployed, you can upgrade the deployment using a new value for the aggregator.replicaCount parameter.
