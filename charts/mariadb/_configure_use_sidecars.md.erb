If additional containers are needed in the same pod as MariaDB (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the *sidecars* parameter. Here is an example:

~~~
sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
       containerPort: 1234
~~~

> NOTE: The Helm chart already includes sidecar containers for the Prometheus exporters. These can be activated by adding the *--enable-metrics=true* parameter at deployment time. The *sidecars* parameter should therefore only be used for any extra sidecar containers.
