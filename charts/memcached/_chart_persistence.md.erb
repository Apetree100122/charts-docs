The [Bitnami Memcached image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-memcached) stores the cache-state at the */cache-state* path of the container if enabled.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/memcached#parameters) to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.
