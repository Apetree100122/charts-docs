Scale the deployment via a normal chart upgrade, following the steps below:.

* Set the password used at installation time via the *password* chart parameter. If the password was generated automatically, obtain the auto-generated paassword from the post-deployment instructions.
* Set the desired number of nodes via the *cluster.nodes* chart parameter. This should not be less than 6.

Here is an example of scaling out a Redis Cluster deployment to 6 nodes. Substitute the PASSWORD placeholder with the original password.

    $ helm upgrade --timeout 600s my-release --set "password=${PASSWORD},cluster.nodes=6" .

> IMPORTANT: To ensure optimal operation of the Redis Cluster, it is highly recommended to run it with at least six nodes. The cluster can work with only five nodes if needed; however, under this scenario, if a master node crashes twice, no other master node will be available for promotion and the cluster will fail.
