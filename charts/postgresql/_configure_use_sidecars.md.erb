If you need additional containers to run within the same pod as PostgreSQL (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the sidecars config parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

~~~
# For the PostgreSQL master
master:
  sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
    - name: portname
     containerPort: 1234
# For the PostgreSQL replicas
slave:
  sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
    - name: portname
     containerPort: 1234
