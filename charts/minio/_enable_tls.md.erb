This chart will facilitate the creation of TLS secrets for use with the ingress controller, however, this is not required. There are four common use cases:

* Helm generates/manages certificate secrets based on the parameters.
* User generates/manages certificates separately.
* Helm creates self-signed certificates and generates/manages certificate secrets.
* An additional tool (like [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/)) manages the secrets for the application.

In the first two cases, it's needed a certificate and a key. Files are expected in **.pem* format.

* If you are going to use Helm to manage the certificates based on the parameters, please copy these values into the *certificate* and *key* values for a given *ingress.secrets* entry.
* In case you are going to manage TLS secrets separately, please know that you must create a TLS secret with name *INGRESS_HOSTNAME-tls* (where *INGRESS_HOSTNAME* is a placeholder to be replaced with the hostname you set using the *ingress.hostname* parameter).
* To use self-signed certificates created by Helm, set *ingress.tls* to *true*, and *ingress.certManager* to *false*.
* If your cluster has a [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates, set *ingress.certManager* boolean to true to enable the corresponding annotations for cert-manager.
