To add a new node to your RabbitMQ cluster, you need to upgrade your installation by providing some parameters to the *helm upgrade* command:

* Pass as *password* the password used in the installation time. If you did not provide a password follow the intructions from the NOTES.txt to get the generated password.
* Set the desired number of nodes at *replicaCount*.
* Set the Erlang cookie at *auth.erlangCookie*.

The following will be an example to add more nodes:

~~~
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/rabbitmq \
--set password=RABBITMQ_PASSWORD \
--set replicaCount=NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS \
--set auth.erlangCookie=RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE
~~~

> NOTE: You need to replace the RABBITMQ_PASSWORD and RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE placeholders with the values obtained in the installation notes.
