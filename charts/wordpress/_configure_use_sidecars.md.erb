If additional containers are needed in the same pod as WordPress (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the *sidecars* parameter. Here is an example:

~~~
sidecars:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
   containerPort: 1234
~~~

If these sidecars export extra ports, extra port definitions can be added using the *service.extraPorts* parameter, as shown in the example below:

~~~
service:
...
  extraPorts:
  - name: extraPort
    port: 11311
    targetPort: 11311
~~~
