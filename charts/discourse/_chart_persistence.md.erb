The [Bitnami Discourse](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-discourse) image stores the Discourse data and configurations at the */bitnami* path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/discourse#parameters) to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.
