The [Bitnami Moodle image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle) stores the  Moodle data and configurations at the */bitnami/moodle* and */bitnami/apache* paths of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, vpshere, and minikube. See the [Parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/moodle#parameters) to configure the PVC or to disable persistence. You may want to review the [PV reclaim policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-pv-reclaim-policy/) and update as required. By default, it's set to delete, and when Moodle is uninstalled, data is also removed.
