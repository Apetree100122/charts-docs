The [Bitnami MongoDB image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mongodb) allows you to use your custom scripts to initialize a fresh instance. In order to execute the scripts, they must be located inside the chart folder files/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d so they can be consumed as a ConfigMap. Also you can create a custom config map and give it via initConfigMap.

The allowed extensions are *.sh*, and *.js*.
