> NOTE: To install the MySQL chart repository it is necessary to have [Helm previously installed and configured in your cluster](../../faq/get-started/install-configure-helm).

To start using the Bitnami MySQL Helm chart, it is necessary to add the Bitnami Helm charts repository to Helm and run the *helm install* command to install the application. Follow these steps:

* Add the Bitnami repository to Helm with the following command:

        $ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

A Helm chart describes a specific version of an application, also known as a "release". The "release" includes files with Kubernetes-needed resources and files that describe the installation, configuration, usage and license of a chart.

* Check that your Kubernetes cluster is running by executing the following command:

        $ kubectl cluster-info

* Install MySQL by running the following:

  > NOTE: Remember that MY-RELEASE is a placeholder, replace it with the name you want to give to the chart or add the `--generate-name` to give the chart a random name. 

        $ helm install MY-RELEASE bitnami/mysql
