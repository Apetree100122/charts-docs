To add a new node to your MySQL cluster, upgrade the installation by providing some parameters to the *helm upgrade* command:

* Pass as *auth.rootPassword* the password used in the installation time. If you did not provide a password, follow the instructions shown in the chart deployment output to get the auto-generated password.
* Set the desired number of nodes using the *secondary.replicaCount* parameter.

Here is an example command to add more nodes. Replace the ROOT_PASSWORD placeholder with the root password and the NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS placeholder with the total number of nodes required.

~~~
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/mysql \
  --set auth.rootPassword=ROOT_PASSWORD \
  --set secondary.replicaCount=NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS
~~~
