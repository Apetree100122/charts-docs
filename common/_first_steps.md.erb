Once you have the chart installed a "Notes" section will be shown at the bottom of the installation information. It contains important instructions about how to obtain your application's IP address or credentials. Please check it carefully:

<%= documentation_img '/images/img/platforms/kubernetes/k8-tutorial-51.png', 'IP address and credentials' %>

To see the content of the "Notes" section at any time, run the following command (remember to replace MY-RELEASE with the name you gave to your deployment when installing the chart): 

    $ helm status MY-RELEASE
