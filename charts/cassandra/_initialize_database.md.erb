The [Bitnami Cassandra image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-cassandra) allows having initialization scripts mounted in */docker-entrypoint.initdb*. This is done in the chart by adding files in the *files/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d* folder (in order to do so, clone this chart) or by setting the initDBConfigMap value with a ConfigMap (named, for example, init-db) that includes the necessary *sh* or *cql* scripts:

~~~
initDBConfigMap=init-db
