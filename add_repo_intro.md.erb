> NOTE: To install a Helm chart repository it is necessary to have [Helm previously installed and configured in your cluster](/<%=platform_path %>/faq/get-started/install-configure-helm).

To start using any Bitnami Helm chart, it is necessary to add the Bitnami Helm charts repository to Helm and run the *helm install* command to deploy this chart. Follow these steps:

* Add the Bitnami repository to Helm with the following command:

        $ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

A Helm chart describes a specific version of a solution, also known as a "release". The "release" includes files with Kubernetes-needed resources and files that describe the installation, configuration, usage and license of a chart.

* Check that your Kubernetes cluster is running by executing the following command:

        $ kubectl cluster-info
