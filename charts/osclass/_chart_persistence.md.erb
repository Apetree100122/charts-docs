The [Bitnami Osclass image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-osclass) stores the Osclass data and configurations at the */bitnami/osclass* path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/osclass#parameters) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.
