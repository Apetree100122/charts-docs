There are cases where it may be necessary to deploy extra objects, such a ConfigMap containing application configuration or an extra deployment with a micro-service used by an application. For these cases, this chart supports adding the full specification of other objects via the *extraDeploy* parameter.

For instance, to deploy your custom *RabbitmqCluster* definition, install the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator using the values below:

```yaml
extraDeploy:
  - apiVersion: rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
    kind: RabbitmqCluster
    metadata:
      name: rabbitmq-custom-configuration
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      rabbitmq:
        additionalConfig: |
          log.console.level = debug
```
