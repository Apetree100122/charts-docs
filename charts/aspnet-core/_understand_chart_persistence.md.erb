Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/aspnet-core#parameters) to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.

To mount an existing PVC to persist the application code is necessary to edit the *values.yaml* file to set some parameters as shown below. Remember to replace the APP_EXISTING_PVC placeholder with the name of an existing PVC that contains the ASP.NET Core application.

~~~
appFromExistingPVC:
  enabled: true
  ## A manually managed Persistent Volume and Claim
  ## PVC must be created manually before volume will be bound
  ## The value is evaluated as a template
  ##
  appFromExistingPVC.existingClaim=APP_EXISTING_PVC
