The [Bitnami Joomla image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-joomla) stores the Joomla data and configurations at the */bitnami/joomla* path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/joomla#parameters) to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.
