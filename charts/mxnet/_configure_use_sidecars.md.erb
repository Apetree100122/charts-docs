If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as Apache MXNet (Incubating) (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the sidecars config parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

~~~
sidecars:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
   containerPort: 1234
~~~

Similarly, you can add extra init containers using the initContainers parameter.

~~~
initContainers:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
   containerPort: 1234
~~~
