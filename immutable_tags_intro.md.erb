It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist. [Learn more about Bitnami's policy on open CVEs](/<%= platform_path %>/open-cve-policy/).
