For performance and security reasons, it is a good practice to configure Apache with AllowOverride None. Instead of using *.htaccess* files, Apache will load the same dircetives at boot time. These directives are located in */opt/bitnami/wordpress/wordpress-htaccess.conf*. The container image includes by default these directives all of the default *.htaccess* files in WordPress (together with the default plugins). To enable this feature, install the chart with the following value: allowOverrideNone=yes

However, some plugins may include *.htaccess* directives that will not be loaded when AllowOverride is set to None. A way to make them work would be to create your own *wordpress-htaccess.conf* file with all the required dircectives to make the plugin work. After creating it, then create a ConfigMap with it and install the chart with the correct parameters:

~~~
allowOverrideNone=true
customHTAccessCM=custom-htaccess
~~~
