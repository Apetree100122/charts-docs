The [Bitnami Parse image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-parse) stores the Parse data and configurations at the */bitnami/parse* path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/parse#parameters) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the image run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions. As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting volumePermissions.enabled to *true*.
