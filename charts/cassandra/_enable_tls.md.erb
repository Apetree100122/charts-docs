You can enable TLS between client and server and between nodes. In order to do so, you need to set the following values:

* For internode cluster encryption, set cluster.internodeEncryption to a value different from none. Available values are *all*, *dc* or *rack*.

* For client-server encryption, set cluster.clientEncryption to true.

In addition to this, you must create a secret containing the keystore and truststore certificates and their corresponding protection passwords. Then, set the tlsEncryptionSecretName when deploying the chart.

You can create the secret (named for example cassandra-tls) using *--from-file=./keystore*, *--from-file=./truststore*, *--from-literal=keystore-password=PUT_YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD* and *--from-literal=truststore-password=PUT_YOUR_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD* options, assuming you have your certificates in your working directory (replace the PUT_YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD and PUT_YOUR_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD placeholders).To deploy Cassandra with TLS you can use those parameters:

~~~
cluster.internodeEncryption=all
cluster.clientEncryption=true
tlsEncryptionSecretName=cassandra-tls
~~~
