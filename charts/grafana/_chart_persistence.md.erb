The [Bitnami Grafana image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-grafana) stores the Grafana data and configurations at the */opt/bitnami/grafana/data* path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/grafana#parameters) to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.
