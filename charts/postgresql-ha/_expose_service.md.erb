There are four different ways to expose the PostgreSQL service:

* Ingress: The ingress controller must be installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Set *ingress.enabled=true* to expose PostgreSQL through Ingress.
* ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster. Set *service.type=ClusterIP* to choose this service type.
* NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). You'll be able to contact the NodePort service, from outside the cluster, by requesting *NodeIP:NodePort*. Set *service.type=NodePort* to choose this service type.
* LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. Set *service.type=LoadBalancer* to choose this service type.
