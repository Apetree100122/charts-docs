The [Bitnami Prestashop image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-prestashop) stores the Prestashop data and configurations at the */bitnami/prestashop* path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/prestashop#parameters) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.
