The [Bitnami JasperReports image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-jasperreports) stores the JasperReports data and configurations at the */bitnami/jasperreports* path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube. See the [Parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/jasperreports#parameters) to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.
