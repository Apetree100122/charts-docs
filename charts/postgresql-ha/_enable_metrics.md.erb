The chart optionally can start a metrics exporter for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). The metrics endpoint (port 9187) is not exposed and it is expected that the metrics are collected from inside the k8s cluster using something similar as the described in the example Prometheus scrape configuration.

* Start a Prometheus exporter:

    - metrics.enabled: false
    + metrics.enabled: true

The exporter allows to create custom metrics from additional SQL queries. See the Chart's *values.yaml* for an example and the [exporters documentation](https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter#adding-new-metrics-via-a-config-file) for more details.
