If additional containers are needed in the same pod (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the *sidecars* parameter. Here is an example:

~~~
sidecars:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
   containerPort: 1234
~~~
