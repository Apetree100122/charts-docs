If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as Discourse (e.g. metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the *sidecars* configuration parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

~~~
sidecars:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
   containerPort: 1234
~~~

If these sidecars export extra ports, you can add extra port definitions using the *service.extraPorts* value:

~~~
service:
...
  extraPorts:
  - name: extraPort
    port: 11311
    targetPort: 11311
~~
