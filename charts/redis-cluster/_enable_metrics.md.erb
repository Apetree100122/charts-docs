The chart optionally can start a metrics exporter for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). The metrics endpoint (port 9121) is exposed in the service. Metrics can be scraped from within the cluster using something similar as the described in the [example Prometheus scrape configuration](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/documentation/examples/prometheus-kubernetes.yml). If metrics are to be scraped from outside the cluster, the Kubernetes API proxy can be utilized to access the endpoint.
