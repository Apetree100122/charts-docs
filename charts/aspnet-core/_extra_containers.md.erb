If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as the ASP.NET Core app (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the *sidecars* configuration parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

~~~
sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
       containerPort: 1234
~~~

Similarly, you can add extra init containers using the initContainers parameter.

~~~
initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234

### Deploying extra resources

There are cases where you may want to deploy extra objects, such a ConfigMap containing your app's configuration or some extra deployment with a micro service used by your app For covering this case, the chart allows adding the full specification of other objects using the *extraDeploy* parameter. The following example would create a *ConfigMap* including some app's configuration, and it will mount it in the ASP.NET Core app's container:

~~~
extraDeploy: |-
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: aspnet-core-configuration
      labels: {{- include "common.labels.standard" . | nindent 6 }}
        {{- if .Values.commonLabels }}
        {{- include "common.tplvalues.render" ( dict "value" .Values.commonLabels "context" $ ) | nindent 6 }}
        {{- end }}
      {{- if .Values.commonAnnotations }}
      annotations: {{- include "common.tplvalues.render" ( dict "value" .Values.commonAnnotations "context" $ ) | nindent 6 }}
      {{- end }}
    data:
      appsettings.json: |-
        {
          "AllowedHosts": "*"
        }
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: configuration
    mountPath: /app/config/
    readOnly: true
extraVolumes:
  - name: configuration
    configMap:
      name: aspnet-core-configuration
