To scale down the MariaDB Galera cluster just perform a normal upgrade setting the *cluster.nodes* value to the desired number of nodes. Also it is needed to provide the password using the password. For example, having more than 3 nodes, to scale down the cluster to 3 nodes:

    $ helm upgrade --timeout 600s <release> --set "password=${MARIADBGALERA_PASSWORD},cluster.nodes=3" .
