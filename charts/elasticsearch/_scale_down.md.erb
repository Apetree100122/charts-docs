To scale down the Elasticsearch deployment just perform a normal upgrade setting the *cluster.nodes* value to the desired number of nodes. Also it is needed to provide the password using the password. For example, having more than 2 nodes, to scale down the cluster to 2 nodes:

    $ helm upgrade --timeout 600s <release> --set "password=${ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD},cluster.nodes=2" .
