To scale down the Redis Cluster just perform a normal upgrade setting the *cluster.nodes* value to the desired number of nodes. It should not be less than 6. Also it is needed to provide the password using the password parameter. For example, having more than 6 nodes, to scale down the cluster to 6 nodes:


    $ helm upgrade --timeout 600s <release> --set "password=${REDIS_PASSWORD},cluster.nodes=6" .

> IMPORTANT: To ensure optimal operation of the Redis Cluster, it is highly recommended to run it with at least six nodes. The cluster can work with only five nodes if needed; however, under this scenario, if a master node crashes twice, no other master node will be available for promotion and the cluster will fail.
