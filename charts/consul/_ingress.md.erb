This chart provides support for ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/nginx-ingress) or [traefik](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/traefik) you can utilize the ingress controller to service your HashiCorp Consul UI application.

To enable ingress integration, please set ingress.enabled to *true*.

### Hosts

Most likely you will only want to have one hostname that maps to this HashiCorp Consul installation, however it is possible to have more than one host. To facilitate this, the ingress.hosts object is an array.

For each item, please indicate a name, tls, tlsSecret, and any annotations that you may want the ingress controller to know about.

Indicating TLS will cause HashiCorp Consul to generate HTTPS urls, and HashiCorp Consul will be connected to at port 443. The actual secret that tlsSecret references does not have to be generated by this chart. However, please note that if TLS is enabled, the ingress record will not work until this secret exists.

For annotations, please see this document. Not all annotations are supported by all ingress controllers, but this document does a good job of indicating which annotation is supported by many popular ingress controllers.
