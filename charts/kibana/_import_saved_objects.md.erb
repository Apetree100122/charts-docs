If you have visualizations and dashboards (in NDJSON format) to import to Kibana, create a ConfigMap that includes them and then install the chart with the *savedObjects.configmap* chart parameter, as shown below:

```
savedObjects.configmap=my-import
```

Alternatively, if the saved objects are available at a URL, import them with the *savedObjects.urls* chart parameter, as shown below:

```
savedObjects.urls[0]=www.my-site.com/import.ndjson
```
