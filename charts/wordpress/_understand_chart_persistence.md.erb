The [Bitnami WordPress image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wordpress) stores the WordPress data and configurations at the */bitnami/* path of the container.

PersistenceVolumeClaims (PVCs) are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and Minikube. The volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning. A number of [parameters](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/wordpress#parameters) are available in the chart to configure the PVCs or to disable persistence.

To scale WordPress, ReadWriteMany PVCs are necessary. Refer to the [chart parameters](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/master/bitnami/wordpress/values.yaml#L188) or the [tutorial on deploying WordPress with scalable NFS-backed storage](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/deploy-applications-nfs-kubernetes) for more information.
