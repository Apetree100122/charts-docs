This chart provides support for Ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/nginx-ingress) or [traefik](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/traefik) you can utilize the ingress controller to serve your ASP.NET Core application.

To enable Ingress integration, please set *ingress.enabled* to *true*.

### Hosts

Most likely you will only want to have one hostname that maps to this ASP.NET Core installation. If that's your case, the property *ingress.hostname* will set it. However, it is possible to have more than one host. To facilitate this, the *ingress.extraHosts* object can be specified as an array. You can also use *ingress.extraTLS* to add the TLS configuration for extra hosts.

For each host indicated at *ingress.extraHosts*, please indicate a *name*, *path*, and any *annotations* that you may want the ingress controller to know about.

For annotations, please see [this document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md). Not all annotations are supported by all Ingress controllers, but this document does a good job of indicating which annotation is supported by many popular Ingress controllers.
